## GETTING STARTED üí≠

This is the Github repository for my personal website. The entire codebase (and site) revolves around the idea of content discoverability, as I built it to allow others to more easily consume content that I create. My previous portfolio was based around projects, but it wasn't extensible or malleable enough for me.

Also, making this site gave me the opportunity to really stretch out and craft a site that felt was mine. The final product is my own creation. It's my own corner of the Internet, a place where I can blog, create, and own my content.

It will also spawn many new personal projects (such as a potential scribing server and more).

Welcome. I hope you enjoy the site as much as I enjoyed making it.

## TECHNOLOGY STACK üêã

I tried to use a completely modern tech stack (both on front-end and back-end) while testing out some new technologies that I'd never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future proof for the coming years. I used:

- Front-End:
  - [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
  - [Formik](https://formik.org/)
  - [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
  - [React Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
  - [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
  - [React Syntax Highlighter](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter)
  - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- Back-end:
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  - [Golang](https://golang.org/)
  - [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/)
