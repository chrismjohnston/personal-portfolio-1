# PORTFOLIO

This is the second iteration of my personal portfolio website. The first one, while good, was lacking two key areas:

1. Personalized style
2. Personal blog

The second iteration of my portfolio contained in this repository is an attempt to fix both of those points while allowing me room to code. As someone who enjoys building awesome products, I enjoyed the challenge of implementing newer technologies (either to tech or to me) such as [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [React-Conflux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-conflux), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). In addition, I had the opportunity to really stretch out and build a site that felt uniquely "mine." It's my own corner of the Internet, a place where I can blog and create to my heart's content.

I hope you enjoy your stay here as much as I enjoyed building it.
